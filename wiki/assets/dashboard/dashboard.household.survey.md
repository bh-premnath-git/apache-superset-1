# dashboard.household.survey

## Purpose

Household-facing dashboard for the household survey part of the repository.

## Source of truth
- File: `assets/dashboards/household_survey.yaml`
- Kind: `Dashboard`
- Runtime name: `Household Survey Overview`
- slug: `household-survey`

## Current chart refs
- `chart.household.rural_segment_comparison` — Handlebars table comparing rural household segments (full-width)
- `chart.household.district_pie_unified` — Cartodiagram with per-district pies for the state currently pinned by the **State** filter (full-width). No context-menu actions — see [chart.household.district_pie_unified](chart.household.district_pie_unified.md) for why.
- `chart.household.district_segment_distribution_bar` — echarts stacked bar of districts × segment on the same dataset as the Cartodiagram above. Exists as the drill-by companion to the map because the Cartodiagram plugin does not register `Behavior.DRILL_BY`.
- `chart.household.minor_structure` — 100%-stacked bar of U15 minor buckets by LCA segment
- `chart.household.segment_distribution_pie` — Overall segment distribution pie (acts as the shared segment legend — colors are stable across every chart via `supersetColors`)
- `chart.household.state_segment_distribution_bar` — Per-state segment stacked bar
- `chart.household.mpce_by_segment` — MPCE (monthly per-capita expenditure) line by segment

## Layout configuration

The dashboard uses:

- `chartHeight: 55` — compact default vertical space for charts
- `chartHeights` — per-chart height overrides for the two data-dense full-width charts:
  - Rural Segments table: `105`
  - District Segments Cartodiagram: `95` (room for pie markers + map controls)
- `fullWidthFirst: 2` — first two charts (Rural Segments table and District Segments Cartodiagram) get full-width rows
- `chartsPerRow: 2` — remaining charts pair up side-by-side

Example from `household_survey.yaml`:
```yaml
spec:
  slug: household-survey
  chartHeight: 55
  fullWidthFirst: 2
  chartsPerRow: 2
  chartHeights:
    chart.household.rural_segment_comparison: 105
    chart.household.district_pie_unified: 70
  chartRefs:
    - chart.household.rural_segment_comparison
    - chart.household.district_pie_unified
    - chart.household.district_segment_distribution_bar
    - chart.household.minor_structure
    - chart.household.segment_distribution_pie
    - chart.household.state_segment_distribution_bar
    - chart.household.mpce_by_segment
```

## Data exploration story

The dashboard is designed so a reader can narrow from "all rural India
segments" down to a single district and see every chart stay in sync.
There are four complementary mechanisms:

### 1. Native filters (top-right filter bar)

| Filter | Default | Targets | What it narrows |
|--------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| **State** | Bihar (first alphabetically) | `hh_master`, `state_district_segment_geo` | Rural Segments table + District Segments map + District Segment Breakdown bar |
| **Sector** | unset | `hh_master` | Rural Segments table only |
| **Social group of HH head** | unset | `hh_master` | Rural Segments table only |

**Filter coverage gap (known):** the four pre-aggregated LCA views
(`segment_distribution`, `segment_minor_bucket`,
`state_segment_distribution`, `mpce_by_segment`) don't carry
`Sector_label` / `Social_Group_of_HH_Head_label` columns, so those
filters have no effect on the summary charts. Extending coverage would
require rebuilding those views to aggregate by the extra dimensions.

### 2. Cross-filters

`crossFiltersEnabled: true` at the dashboard level. Clicking a district pie slice on the District Segments map or a cell in a summary chart pins
that value as an ephemeral filter that propagates to every other chart
whose dataset exposes the clicked column. Clear a cross-filter from the
small chip that appears above the dashboard.

### 3. Drill to detail (Superset built-in)

Right-click any chart whose upstream `ChartMetadata` registers
`Behavior.DRILL_TO_DETAIL` → **Drill to detail** → Superset shows the
raw rows from the source dataset that feed the aggregated cell.
`FEATURE_FLAGS["DRILL_TO_DETAIL"] = True` in `superset_config.py`
enables the feature at the app level; per-chart availability still
depends on the plugin's `behaviors` list. Useful for: "which
households in Bhagalpur landed in the R1 slice?"

### 4. Drill by (Superset built-in)

Right-click any chart whose upstream `ChartMetadata` registers
`Behavior.DRILL_BY` → **Drill by** → pick another column from the
dataset → Superset opens a chart pivoted on that dimension.
`FEATURE_FLAGS["DRILL_BY"] = True` in `superset_config.py` enables
the feature at the app level; per-chart availability still depends
on the plugin's `behaviors` list. Useful sequence:

1. On the **Distribution of Segments in 3 States** pie (`pie`) →
   drill by `state_label` → segment share per state.
2. On **Segment Distribution within State** bar
   (`echarts_timeseries_bar`) → drill by `segment` → per-segment
   ordering within each state.
3. On **District Segment Breakdown (Drill-by)** bar
   (`echarts_timeseries_bar`) → drill by `district_name` /
   `segment` → district-level counts within the currently-selected
   state. This chart is the drill-by path for the map next to it.

Drill-by uses the same dataset columns the chart already references, so
it "just works" for charts whose dataset carries rich dimensions
(notably `hh_master` and `state_district_segment_geo`).

**Upstream exceptions on this dashboard (no context menu at all):**

- **Cartodiagram** (`chart.household.district_pie_unified` — "District
  Segments by State"). Upstream
  `plugin-chart-cartodiagram/src/plugin/index.ts` constructs its
  `ChartMetadata` without a `behaviors` entry, so neither
  `Behavior.DRILL_BY` nor `Behavior.DRILL_TO_DETAIL` is registered.
  Right-clicking the map surfaces no drill menu items regardless of
  the feature flags. `chart.household.district_segment_distribution_bar`
  is the companion that exposes drill-by over the same dataset.
- **Handlebars** (`chart.household.rural_segment_comparison` — "Rural
  Segments table"). Upstream does not expose the context menu on this
  viz. Cross-filters remain the only interaction path. Rebuilding it
  as a Pivot Table or Table chart would restore drill-by.

The other four charts (`household_minor_structure` —
`echarts_timeseries_bar`, `segment_distribution_pie` — `pie`,
`state_segment_distribution_bar` — `echarts_timeseries_bar`,
`mpce_by_segment` — `echarts_timeseries_line`) are all echarts plugins
and expose both menu items out of the box.

### Recommended exploration flow

1. Load the dashboard — State filter is pre-pinned to **Bihar**, so the
   District Segments map renders only Bihar's districts.
2. Scan the pies — segment colours are stable across every chart on the
   dashboard (via `color_scheme: supersetColors`) so a slice colour on
   this chart matches the same segment in the Segment Distribution pie
   and the State Segment Distribution bar.
3. Click a pie slice → cross-filter pins that `(district, segment)`
   → the Rural Segments table + summary charts update in place.
4. Right-click the pinned segment → **Drill to detail** → see the
   raw households.
5. Switch the State filter to Jharkhand or Madhya Pradesh to repeat.
6. For summary-chart exploration (segment distribution, MPCE, minor
   structure), use **Drill by** on each chart — those views are
   aggregated across all three states so the State filter doesn't
   apply.

## Operational notes

The dashboard layout is managed by the reconciler. When chart refs are available, the dashboard receives an auto-generated grid layout with the specified `chartHeight` and `chartHeights` overrides.

If a chart ref is missing at reconcile time, the reconciler logs the missing chart but can still preserve the dashboard resource.

- `superset_config.py` — `FEATURE_FLAGS["DRILL_BY"]` /

  is available on every chart type whose upstream `ChartMetadata`
  registers the corresponding `Behavior`.
